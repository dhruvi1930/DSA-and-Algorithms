# DSA-and-Algorithms

### What is Data Structure ?

Way of Organizing data in a effective way.

### What is Algorithms ?

Sets of instructions to solve problems.

### Big O Notation

#### Time Complexity:

How long an algorithms will take to run

#### O(n)

     Execution time of algorithms to grow linearly to proportion of input size data(n).

#### O(1): Constant Time

     Execution time of algorithms remains constant regardless of input size.

#### O(n^2)

     Execution time of algorithms grows quadratically with size of n.

#### O(log n)

     Execution time of algorithms grows logarithmically with size of n.

     As the input size increases, the time it takes for algorithms to run increases slowly.

#### Space Complexity:

How much memory it will need as the amount of data grows.

### Array DS

An ordered collection of elements that can accessed using numeric index.
