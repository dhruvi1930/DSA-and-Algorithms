# DSA-and-Algorithms

### What is Data Structure ?
    Way of Organizing data in a effective way.
### What is Algorithms ?
    Sets of intructions to solve problems.
### Big O Notation

#### Time Complexity:
     How long an algorithms will take to run
     Ex: O(n), O(1),O(n^2),O(log n) where n is input data size
#### Space Complexity:
     How much memory it will need as the amount of data grows.
