# DSA-and-Algorithms

### What is Data Structure ?

Way of Organizing data in a effective way.

### What is Algorithms ?

Sets of instructions to solve problems.

### Big O Notation

#### Time Complexity:

How long an algorithms will take to run

#### O(n)

     Execution time of algorithms to grow linearly to proportion of input size data(n).

#### O(1): Constant Time

     Execution time of algorithms remains constant regardless of input size.

#### O(n^2)

     Execution time of algorithms grows quadratically with size of n.

#### O(log n)

     Execution time of algorithms grows logarithmically with size of n.

     As the input size increases, the time it takes for algorithms to run increases slowly.

#### Space Complexity:

How much memory it will need as the amount of data grows.

### Array DS

An ordered collection of elements that can accessed using numeric index.

### LinkedList

A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

#### Singly LinkedList

A type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail)

#### Doubly LinkedList

A bidirectional linked list; i.e., you can traverse it from head to tail node or tail to head node.

### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out)

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that functions like a waiting in lines and follows FIFO (First In First Out).

##### Enqueue

Adds an item from the back of the queue.

#### Dequeue

Removes an item from the front of the queue.
